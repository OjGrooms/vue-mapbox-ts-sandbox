= Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite Wrapped in Tauri

== Purpose:
----
To demonstrate an issue seen in using auto resize for the map.
----

=====
You must provide a token, a field is availible in the map header. You can track it through the emit: header -> map view -> mainStore.mapToken -> mapModal -> vueMapbox

To test: Set window size by dragging a corner. Select a locaiton from the dropdown

To change to 'normal behavior': remove the `auto-resize` v-bind from `VueMapBoxTs.vue ln 57`
and drag the corner again to force the map to resize before opening the map
